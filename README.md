# Zillow
Los Angeles is the first place I moved into after graduating from masters, and like any small town kid I was surprised by this big beautiful city I have landed myself in. It was a dream come true for me. But the time I made the move was around when pandemic started(Covid-19), people were on the verge of being evicted from their apartments, losing jobs and with all this going on I also realized how difficult it was to sustain a life in this expensive city. Housing prices are sky rocketing here, that's when I thought of building a regression model for which I need housing price data and what's the best way to get an updated data then web scrapping from a most used web site on housing prices? Nothing....so here's the code that I build using python on web scrapping.
